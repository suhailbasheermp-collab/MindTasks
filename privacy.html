    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025-04-27</p>
    
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Mind & Tasks</strong> app (hereby referred to as "Application") created by Suhail Basheer (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application does not collect or transmit any personally identifiable information to external servers. All data entered into the Application (such as tasks, journal entries, and settings) is stored locally on your device using <strong>Local Storage</strong> technologies.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Since data is stored locally on your device, you retain full control over your data. Clearing the Application's data or uninstalling the Application will result in the deletion of your stored information.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. As no data is transmitted to the Service Provider, no such collection is possible.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>
